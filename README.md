# Minecraft Maze Generator

A powerful web-based tool for generating multi-level mazes that can be imported into Minecraft Bedrock Edition worlds. This tool creates complex 3D mazes with customizable dimensions, wall properties, and block types, then exports them as Minecraft function files.

**Note**: This project is currently focused on Bedrock Edition compatibility. Java Edition support may be added in future versions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer ‚Äì Vibe Code Ahead

This project was built by a non-developer dad (that's me) using a healthy mix of vibes, curiosity, and help from AI tools like ChatGPT. I wanted to make something cool for my son ‚Äî a way to quickly generate Minecraft mazes and have some fun together.

The code might not follow best practices, and there's probably a more "correct" way to do things ‚Äî but hey, it works (mostly), and we had a blast making it.

Use at your own risk, tweak as you like, and most importantly: have fun with it.

## üìã Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Minecraft Bedrock Edition (for importing generated mazes)
- Basic knowledge of Minecraft behavior packs (for installation)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

### For Users

1. **Generate a Maze**:
   - Visit the live demo or open `index.html` in your browser
   - Configure maze dimensions (width, height, levels)
   - Adjust wall properties (width, height, path width)
   - Choose your preferred block type
   - Use the 3D Maze controls to enable/disable ladders for all vertical passages
   - Click "Download function" to get your `.mcfunction` file

2. **Import into Minecraft**:
   - **Quick Start**: Use the [Microsoft Behavior Pack Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/minecraft-samples/tree/main/behavior_pack_sample) as a template
   - **Manual Setup**: Create a behavior pack in your Minecraft Bedrock world
   - Place the downloaded `.mcfunction` file in the `functions` folder
   - Use `/function [filename]` in-game to generate the maze

### For Developers

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brdlyp/brdlyp.github.io.git
   cd brdlyp.github.io
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```

4. **Open in browser**:
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or serve the files using a local web server

## üéØ How It Works

### Maze Generation Algorithm

The project uses the **Growing Tree algorithm** with a 50/50 split between random and newest cell selection. This creates mazes with a good balance of complexity and solvability.

### 3D Maze Structure

- **Levels**: Multiple horizontal layers connected by vertical passages
- **Walls**: Configurable thickness and height using any Minecraft block
- **Paths**: Walkable corridors with customizable width
- **Connections**: Ladders connect different levels using a robust multi-strategy system
- **Visualization**: 2D top-down view of each level with indicators for vertical connections and ladder placement method

### Ladder Placement Logic

Ladders are placed using a multi-strategy system:
- **Primary**: Place ladders on solid internal walls (no passage)
- **Fallback 1**: Place ladders on corners/pillars if no solid wall is available
- **Fallback 2**: Dynamically create a temporary wall for ladder placement if needed
- **Fallback 3**: Ceiling-mount ladders as a last resort
- **Smart Hole Placement**: (future) Optionally, prioritize hole placement in cells with more solid walls

The system ensures ladders are always placed, even in highly connected or edge-case mazes.

### File Generation

The tool generates Minecraft function files containing:
- Block placement commands for walls, paths, and ladders
- Proper coordinate calculations for 3D space
- Optimized command structure for efficient execution
