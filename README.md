# Minecraft Maze Generator

A powerful web-based tool for generating multi-level mazes that can be imported into Minecraft Bedrock Edition worlds. This tool creates complex 3D mazes with customizable dimensions, wall properties, and block types, then exports them as Minecraft function files.

**Note**: This project is currently focused on Bedrock Edition compatibility. Java Edition support may be added in future versions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer ‚Äì Vibe Code Ahead

This project was built by a non-developer dad (that's me) using a healthy mix of vibes, curiosity, and help from AI tools like ChatGPT. I wanted to make something cool for my son ‚Äî a way to quickly generate Minecraft mazes and have some fun together.

The code might not follow best practices, and there's probably a more "correct" way to do things ‚Äî but hey, it works (mostly), and we had a blast making it.

Use at your own risk, tweak as you like, and most importantly: have fun with it.

## üéÆ Features

- **Multi-Level Maze Generation**: Create complex 3D mazes with multiple levels
- **Customizable Dimensions**: Adjust width, height, and number of levels
- **Flexible Wall Properties**: Configure wall width, height, and path width
- **Block Type Selection**: Choose any Minecraft block type for walls
- **Visual Preview**: Interactive 2D top-down view of each maze level with level navigation
- **Minecraft Function Export**: Generate `.mcfunction` files ready for import
- **Growing Tree Algorithm**: Uses an advanced maze generation algorithm for optimal path creation
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI built with Bulma CSS framework

## üöÄ Live Demo

Try the maze generator online: [Minecraft Maze Generator](https://brdlyp.github.io)

## üìã Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Minecraft Bedrock Edition (for importing generated mazes)
- Basic knowledge of Minecraft behavior packs (for installation)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

### For Users

1. **Generate a Maze**:
   - Visit the live demo or open `index.html` in your browser
   - Configure maze dimensions (width, height, levels)
   - Adjust wall properties (width, height, path width)
   - Choose your preferred block type
   - Click "Download function" to get your `.mcfunction` file

2. **Import into Minecraft**:
   - **Quick Start**: Use the [Microsoft Behavior Pack Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/minecraft-samples/tree/main/behavior_pack_sample) as a template
   - **Manual Setup**: Create a behavior pack in your Minecraft Bedrock world
   - Place the downloaded `.mcfunction` file in the `functions` folder
   - Use `/function [filename]` in-game to generate the maze

### For Developers

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brdlyp/brdlyp.github.io.git
   cd brdlyp.github.io
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Open in browser**:
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or serve the files using a local web server

## üéØ How It Works

### Maze Generation Algorithm

The project uses the **Growing Tree algorithm** with a 50/50 split between random and newest cell selection. This creates mazes with a good balance of complexity and solvability.

### 3D Maze Structure

- **Levels**: Multiple horizontal layers connected by vertical passages
- **Walls**: Configurable thickness and height using any Minecraft block
- **Paths**: Walkable corridors with customizable width
- **Connections**: Stairs and ladders connect different levels
- **Visualization**: 2D top-down view of each level with indicators for vertical connections

### File Generation

The tool generates Minecraft function files containing:
- Block placement commands for walls and paths
- Proper coordinate calculations for 3D space
- Optimized command structure for efficient execution
