The ability to download an mcfunction file with either
- Just the maze walls and maze path air blocks (no floors)
- Just the maze path airblocks (no walls or floor blocks)

Use fancy maze masks to generate rooms.

Improve ladder generation when adjusting wall and path widths.


- Add support for generating mazes with multiple floors or vertical layers, allowing for more complex 3D mazes.
- Implement a maze randomizer seed input, so users can recreate or share specific maze layouts.
- Allow users to customize block types for walls, floors, and paths in the generated mcfunction files.
- Add an option to generate mazes with hidden rooms or secret passages that are only accessible via puzzles or levers.
- Integrate a preview feature that visualizes the maze in 2D or 3D before downloading.
- Support for generating mazes with different shapes (circular, hexagonal, triangular) instead of just rectangular grids.
- Add a feature to automatically place loot chests or mob spawners at random or strategic locations within the maze.
- Allow export to other Minecraft structure formats (e.g., .nbt for structure blocks).
- Implement a difficulty setting that adjusts maze complexity, dead ends, and path length.
- Add a 'maze race' mode that generates two parallel mazes for competitive play.
- Provide an API or command-line interface for batch-generating mazes with different parameters.
- Add educational features, such as step-by-step maze generation visualization for teaching algorithms.
